# go-whosonfirst-privatezen

Go package for working with Who's On First "privatezen" documents.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically a version of Go more recent than 1.6 so let's just assume you need [Go 1.8](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Important

Do not try to use this yet. It is not ready for you. It is an experimental package to work through a series of overlapping questions in both the [go-whosonfirst-sqlite-privatezen](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-sqlite-privatezen) and [electron-whosonfirst-bookmarks](https://github.com/whosonfirst/electron-whosonfirst-bookmarks) projects.
